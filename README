Modifying Review Data
This script needs to be run twice once with MainFarmer = 99 and other farmers = 1
The second time needs to be MainFarmer and all other farmers = 0
NOTE: You will need to copy the original data first and also specify the file name as well.

$ python reviewModification.py

If you want to have user weight of one you will need to create data set of (userID, 1)
To do this you can run the extractData with the commented code in main uncommented.

## UserData Needs to be processed with PageRank Method before this
##  Location can be set at the top of this script, or specified here.
#userData = sc.textFile(user_data) \
#  .map(lambda x: clean_user(x)) \
#  .saveAsTextFile(“/home/derekn/CS6965/yelp_dataset_challenge_academic_dataset/user_data”)
#sys.exit(1)

Then save as a text file so you can add farmer information.
Run the script userModify.py to add the farmer informaion to the text file.
To modify the user JSON data use userModifyJSON.py
NOTE: You will need to copy the original data first and also specify the file name as well.

$ python userModify.py
$ python userModifyJSON.py

To run the calculations we first need the user weight made.
Then we can run the following scripts.
NOTE: These scripts output a vector (key, value) for each combination of the data.

$ python extractData.py
$ python simple.py
$ python other.py

They also output statistical data to a file. The files are:
output_extractData.out
output_simple.out
output_other.out

extractData uses our ranking algorithm with time depreciation and advantage rate
simple is our ranking algorithm without time depreciation and advantage rate
other is averaging and useful weight

If you want to just run one or two there is a variable “iteration” that you can modify to select the
code you want. THis iteration variable allows you to select the desired initial setting. You can always
assert the “doneFlag” to be true to stop iterations in the while loop.

When all these scripts finish then you can run this script.
$ python search.py

This will also output to a file output_search.out which summarizes the results.
NOTE: It displays a result for every possible test.

Again if you want to modify the search just the same as the other three scripts you can do so the same way as above.
